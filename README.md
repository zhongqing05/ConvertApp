# ConvertAPP - 国际话(Localization) 工具

In the process of developing a project, many times we develop the project to the end of the period, and suddenly the product comes with a sentence to match English, Thai, and Malay. To pick out Chinese from tens of thousands of lines of code, it is not possible to replace it with `NSLocalizedString(key, comment)`. This is not the programmer's approach. So I wrote this gadget later to quickly match the Chinese in the project.
